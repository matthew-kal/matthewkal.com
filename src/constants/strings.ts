  "Beyond the world of tech, I'm an avid adventurer. I've explored 15 countries, fueling my passion for travel, and last season alone I hit the slopes 18 times on my snowboard. When I'm not chasing powder or new horizons, you can find me at the gym, out for a run, or slicing it onto the next fairway at the golf course.";
